## Research Question

How does the air pollution rate impact the violent crime rate in Baltimore City?Â 

![](pollutioncrime.webp){width="237"}

## Data Wrangling

**Outcome variable**

Our outcome variable is the crime rates in specific neighborhoods.

The data comes from the Baltimore Police Department as part of Open Data Baltimore.<https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/part-1-crime-data/explore>

We categorized each of the crime entries into property crimes and violent crimes, and then organized them by date, as shown in the code below.

```{r}

#| eval: false
#| echo: false
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")

#Read crime data
crime <- read.csv("crime_14_22.csv")
crime2<-crime %>%
  
  mutate(Violent= ifelse(Description== "HOMICIDE", 1, 0)) %>%
  
  mutate(Violent= ifelse(Description== "AGG. ASSAULT", 1, Violent)) %>%
  
  mutate(Violent= ifelse(Description== "COMMON ASSAULT", 1, Violent)) %>% 
  
  mutate(Violent= ifelse(Description== "RAPE", 1, Violent)) %>% 
  
  mutate(Violent= ifelse(Description== "SHOOTING", 1, Violent)) %>% 
  
  mutate(Property= ifelse(Description== "ROBBERY - CARJACKING", 1, 0)) %>%
  
  mutate(Violent= ifelse(Description== "ROBBERY - COMMERCIAL", 1, Violent)) %>%
  
  mutate(Violent= ifelse(Description== "ROBBERY - STREET", 1,Violent)) %>%
  
  mutate(Violent= ifelse(Description== "ROBBERY - RESIDENCE", 1, Violent)) %>%
  
  mutate(Property= ifelse(Description== "ARSON", 1, Property)) %>%
  
  mutate(Property= ifelse(Description== "AUTO THEFT", 1, Property)) %>%
  
  mutate(Property= ifelse(Description== "BURGLARY", 1, Property)) %>%
  
  mutate(Property= ifelse(Description== "LARCENY", 1, Property)) %>%
  
  mutate(Property= ifelse(Description== "LARCENY FROM AUTO", 1, Property)) %>%
  
  mutate(Race = ifelse(Race == "", "UNKNOWN", Race)) %>%
  
  mutate(Neighborhood = ifelse(Neighborhood == "", "UNKNOWN", Neighborhood))

crime_by_date <- crime2 %>%
  group_by(Neighborhood, date) %>%
  summarize(total_violent_crime = sum(Violent), total_property_crime = sum(Property))
```

Then we visualized the violent and property crimes by neighborhood shown on the graphs below. The graphs represent the crime levels of the different types of crime, sorted by neighborhood.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library("terra")
#library("tidyverse")

n<-vect("Neighborhood/Neighborhood.shp")
n_project<-project(n, "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ")
n_project$Name <- toupper(n_project$Name)

df_sum <- read.csv("finaldata.csv") %>%
  filter(Name %in% n_project$Name) %>%
  group_by(Name) %>%
  summarise(all_violent = sum(total_violent_crime), 
            all_property = sum(total_property_crime))
n2<-merge(n_project, df_sum, by = "Name")

plot(n2, "all_violent", plg = list(title = "Violent Crimes by Neighborhood"))
plot(n2, "all_property", plg = list(title = "Property Crimes by Neighborhood"))
```

**Treatment variable**

The treatment variable is an indicator of whether there is wind in each county. We distinguished this by separating each date-neighborhood with a 0 or 1. A 0 meant there was no wind flowing in the direction of that county, ergo no pollution that day. Similarly, a 1 meant there was wind flowing in that direction, ergo pollution was present.

This data was obtained by NASA MERRA Data.

In this code, we first found the angle of each county using the coordinate points from our data. Then, we converted the angles to degrees. Finally, we categorized whether or not the county had wind flowing in its direction with a zero or one using a if else statement.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false

library("terra")
library("tidyterra")

all<-read.csv("full_merge.csv") %>%
  rename(Name=Neighborhood) %>%
  mutate(wind_dir=atan2(ULML, VLML)*(180/pi))

all2<-merge(df2, all, by="Name")%>%
  mutate(treatment = ifelse(wind_dir > min_ang & wind_dir< max_ang, 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(treatment)) %>%
  select(-X.x, -X.y, -ang1, -ang2, -n1x, -n2x, -n1y, -n2y, -ULML, -VLML)

write.csv(all2, "finaldata.csv", row.names = F)

test<-all2 %>%
  select(min_ang, max_ang, wind_dir) %>%
  mutate(in_dir = ifelse(wind_dir > min_ang & wind_dir< max_ang, 1, 0))
```

**Control variables**

The control variables we have taken into account are certain neighborhood characteristics such as the majority race and gender of the neighborhood.

The code below demonstrates the merging between the data sets of crime by race, neighborhood, and date.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library("tidyverse")
library("dplyr")

intersect<-read.csv("road_neighborhood_intersect.csv")
race<-read.csv("crime_by_race.csv")
race2 = subset(race, select = -c(X))
intersect2<-intersect %>%
  mutate(Neighborhood = toupper(ndf))
colnames(intersect2)[3] <- "intersects_with_road"
intersect3 = subset(intersect2, select = -c(X, ndf))
crime_by_race_date_intersect <- full_join(race2, intersect3, by = "Neighborhood")
```

## Preliminary Results

This graph shows the average amount number of violent crimes per day for 20 random counties in the dataset, on days where there was wind/pollution (blue) and days where there was no wind/no pollution (red).

## Did Regression Models

This is a Did regression model with our treatment group, treatment period, and there interaction.

```{r}
library("lfe")

panel <- read.csv("paneldata(1).csv")
summary(mode <- lm(total_violent_crime~treatment, data = panel))
```

This is a Did regression model that includes everything from the previous model, plus all of out other numerical, binary, and categorical variables.

```{r}
Model4<- felm(total_violent_crime~treatment + TLML + PRECTOT + SPEED| Name + month + dayofweek + year, data = panel)
summary(Model4)
```

The first regression was statistically significant because the treatment variable had three stars. However, our second regression was statistically insignificant when we added more variables to our model, making it inconclusive.
